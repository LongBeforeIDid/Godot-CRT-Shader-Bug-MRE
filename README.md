# Godot CRT Shader Bug MRE

Minimum reproducable example of the godot shader bug described in this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1om8qb2/comment/nmpp7h0/?context=1

The bug seems to be monitor-dependent. If the issue appears on your machine, I'd love to know what your monitor specs are to try and better understadn what's happening here.
